            Why?
            It brings you more bang for your buck than paid advertising, paid search, or paid ads.
            Content marketing is organic marketing, which means, when you implement it into your marketing as a strategy, it naturally generates leads and traffic over time.
            Think of it like this: Content marketing is a seed that, when well-planted and tended, grows into a mighty tree that continually bears fruit in the form of traffic and leads – even sales if you do it right. ?
            That means, instead of shelling out oodles of cash to shove your brand name in front of your target customers’ faces (and praying it works), your customers will come to you. They’ll do a Google search on a topic that interests them, or on a pain point they need to be solved, and they’ll come across your content.
            And, with a content strategy in place, your content will present as the solution, education, or entertainment your customer needs at that exact moment in time. As they continue to have this type of interaction with your brand, they’ll follow your posts. They’ll subscribe to your email list. They’ll follow you on social media.
            Play your cards (and your content strategy) right, and pretty soon you’ll have a loyal, paying customer on your side.
            It all starts with content. But don’t just take my word for it.
            
            Leads brought in with content marketing convert at a higher rate: 16% (content marketing) vs. 1.7% (traditional marketing, like ads).
            Consumers are 131% more likely to buy from a brand after reading some of their content.
            One content marketing campaign delivers 3x more leads than digital ads.
            Despite the effects of the pandemic on businesses across the board, 68% of marketers still expect their content marketing budgets to increase in 2021, because they understand the long-term gains.</p>
